# TODO: Re-enable volsync backups. Disabled due to mover permission errors
# (VolSync drops ALL capabilities, so even root can't read restricted files)
# causing endless retry loops and IO storms on the single-node cluster.
# Fix: either patch VolSync to allow DAC_READ_SEARCH capability, or fix
# file permissions on source PVCs before re-enabling.
